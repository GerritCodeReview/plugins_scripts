Local-refdb utility
==============================

COMMANDS
----
`localrefdb count-refs` utility to count the number of refs per project and register a metric called `num_ref_per_project_<project name>`
`localrefdb sha1-all-refs` utility to combine all SHA1 of all refs into a new SHA1 and produce a numeric represetation of it.
This will also register a metric called `sha1_all_refs_per_project_<project name>`


SYNOPSIS
--------
>     ssh -p <port> <host> local count-refs PROJECT [--verbose]
>     ssh -p <port> <host> globalrefdb sha1-all-refs PROJECT [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

## Count-refs
A metric generated by a simple count of all refs in a project except for the user-edit refs, as these are not usually replicated.

## Sha1-all-refs
A metric generated by combining all SHA1 in a project except for the user-edit refs, as these are not usually replicated.
The SHA1 is then converted into a numerical value so that a metric can be registered

ACCESS
------
Any user who has been granted the 'Administrate Server' capability.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

EXAMPLES
--------
Count refs in project

>     $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com localrefdb count-ref All-Users

Update global-refdb's sha1

>     $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com localrefdb sha1-all-refs All-Users
